# Blank and Empty

## Description

> This file seems blank, but it's hiding some secrets. (Wrap the flag in LITCTF{})
 
## Solution

Given file looks like this:

![](https://github.com/alp361/ctf-writeups/blob/main/LIT%20CTF%202023/Blank%20and%20Empty/images/given_file.png)

After a little research I thought it might have been created with whitespace language. <br>
Then I tried to decode it and retrieve the flag.

```
